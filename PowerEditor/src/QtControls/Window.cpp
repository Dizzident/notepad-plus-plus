#include "Window.h"

// This empty .cpp file is required for Qt's MOC (Meta-Object Compiler)
// The Window class has the Q_OBJECT macro, which causes MOC to generate
// meta-object code for signals/slots and runtime type information.
// This file ensures the MOC-generated code is compiled and linked.
//
// The MOC-generated code is automatically included by CMake's AUTOMOC
// when this .cpp file is compiled.

namespace QtControls {

// No additional implementation needed - all methods are inline in the header
// The virtual destructor and other virtual functions are defined as default
// in the header file.
